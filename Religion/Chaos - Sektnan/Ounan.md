## Introduction
It is unclear whether this is the third or fourth personality of [[Chaos - Sektnan|Chaos]] as it is believed to have been created simultaneously with [[Venan]].

The personality of optimism— the ability to look into the future and grasp it. To continue living and believe there is reason for anything.

While an abstract idea at first, optimism is what leads any and all technological developments. If rational creatures were unable to find meaning in existence, how could they create anything? Why would they create anything?

If there were no optimism, then projects would be scrapped from the get-go. The idea of the end result being a positive one is what drives progress.

Is often a main contributor to joy along with [[Venan]].
## Ouknan
Simply put, Ouknan is the personality that freezes progress. Whenever he is in control, [[Ahda'an]] enters the dark ages, where there is no reason to continue living or developing. While Ounan may maintain some control— the reason why people don’t just stop eating— Ouknan puts an end to the idea of the future.
