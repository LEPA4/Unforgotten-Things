## Introduction
Aanan was the second personality of [[Chaos - Sektnan|Chaos]].

This personality is the balance between good and evil. Yet the line between Aanan and Aknan are faint, thus evil always penetrates reality. However, such a lack of purity from Aanan is what drives society. As such, pact later formed with [[Ounan]] prevents Aanan from completely barring Aknan. 

Aanan’s power is strong, at least the lack of Aanan’s power is, and can often indirectly interfere with the other personalities, leading to moments of increased destruction and hatred—Even if those personalities maintain control.
## Aknan
Pure evil. Seeing how evil is one of the strongest forces in the world, Aknan is easily able to keep Aanan’s influence at bay. During these moments, there may be some influence of Aanan, thought it is limited.
