## Introduction
Aanan was the second personality of [[Chaos - Sektnan|Chaos]].

This personality manages the balance of good and evil. While it is often wondered why there is evil, it is because of the near-transparent line that divides Aanan with Aknan. Because of this, there will never be 100% good. And because 100% good would be worse than 100% bad. Aanan realized the need for evil to create purpose in the lives in others and accepted some of Aknan’s control.
## Aknan
Pure evil. Seeing how evil is one of the strongest forces in the world, Aknan is easily able to keep Aanan’s influence at bay. During these moments, there may be some influence of Aanan, thought it is limited.
