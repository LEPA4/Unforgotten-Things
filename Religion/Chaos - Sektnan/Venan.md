## Introduction
Venan is either the third or fourth personality of [[Chaos - Sektnan|Chaos]], sometimes believed to be created simultaneously with [[Ounan]].

This personality manages love and friendships. The connection of all rational creatures. Venan manages trust and relationships.

How much rational creatures care for each other relies heavily on [[Aanan]]. If there is evil, then mistrust will prevail or hatred will blossom.

Without Venan, the world would crumble, for collaboration would end. Selflessness and empathy would die, which is exactly what happens when Veknan takes over. While selfishness and hatred and mistrust still exist, they are to a lesser degree while Venan is in control. Competition and greed leads to developments. Mistrust leads to survival. 

While every problem would be solved if there was 100% collaboration and perfect relationship, Veknan’s lingering influence prevents that, therefore everything must exist to offset. Additionally, because [[Aanan]] (good/evil) is quite intertwined with Venan (love/hate), [[Aanan#Aknan|Aknan’s]] influence can also make imperfections necessary for survival.

Is often a main contributor to joy along with [[Ounan]].
## Veknan
Veknan drives rational creatures apart. He destroys trust, love, empathy, and selflessness. Whenever Veknan is in control, no strength of a bond can withstand his severing knife.

Creatures become greedy and skeptical of the reason behind another rational creature. Their actions are carried out with only their own goals in mind.
