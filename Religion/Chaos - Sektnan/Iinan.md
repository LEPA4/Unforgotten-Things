## Introduction
Iinan is often attributed to being the first personality of [[Chaos - Sektnan|Chaos]].

This personality is capable of altering the physical. Everything except thoughts and ideas are managed by him, for that task was passed along to the other personalities upon their creation.

When Iinan was born, [[Ahda'an]], had already been created. Chaos had sculped their landscapes, though left them a barren gray. For this, Iinan had created life. The first cells to evolve and shape what was soon to become society.

Through experimentation, Iinan was able to create many diverse creatures.

Once rational thought developed, Chaos took Iinan’s control and divided thinking to the other personalities. 
## Power
When Chaos created the other personalities, Iinan strained to retain control. For this, he created the [[Ardians]]. They were the perfect solution to his problem. A slave to him, and him alone. To enable them to follow his request, Iinan granted them a subset of his power— though it had unintentionally passed on to every other creature. Thus creating [[Life Essence]].
## Iknan
The opposite of creative, this personality is capable of destroying anything it pleases. In the blink of an eye, Ahda'an could disappear. While Iinan does possess the power to destroy, Iknan only knows destruction.

Throughout Ahda'an’s history, Iknan has brough about temporary times of famine, plague, and catastrophe.
