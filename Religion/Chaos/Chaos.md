## Introduction
Chaos (known as Sektnan) is split into four subsets, commonly referred to as the personalities of Chaos by the [[Ardians|Ardian]] religious figures.
These four personalities are:
1. [[Iinan]] | Creative
2. [[Aanan]] | Lawful
3. [[Venan]] | Love
4. [[Ounan]] | Optimistic
Each leads a specific role in maintaining Chaos’ domain.

Being the ideas of Chaos, they are susceptible to it’s nature. Occasionally, there are times when a personality will switch with their counterpart:
1. [[Iinan#Iknan|Iknan]] | Destructive
2. [[Aanan#Aknan|Aknan]] | Lawless
3. [[Venan#Veknan|Veknan]] | Hate
4. [[Ounan#Ouknan|Ouknan]] | Pessimistic
Sometimes, it is for only a moment that these personalities will switch, which is the explanation for *most* disasters. However, whenever a personality swaps for a longer period of time, it is often called an [[Ages|Age]].
## Feuds
Because Iinan has the most power— the ability to alter anything— the other personalities often distrust and dislike Iinan. Because of this, Chaos’ personalities agreed to create [[#Rules|rules]] by which they must abide.

There are constant shifts in power within Chaos as one personality may become more powerful, or have more control, than another. This, too, will lead to problems that often impact [[Ahda'an]].
