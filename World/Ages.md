## Introduction
It’s common for there to be times when a specific personality will have more control, and their power will be more potent. During those times, the world can change drastically; for better or worse. Those who still practice the [[Chaos - Sektnan|True Religion]] (the [[Ardians]]), or historians, believe there to be five notable ages: [[#Age of Beginning|The Age of Beginning]], [[#Age of Sin|The Age of Life]], [[#Age of Sin|The Age of Sin]], [[#Age of Destruction|The Age of Destruction]], and [[#Age of Reconstruction|The Age of Reconstruction]]. Each age is represented by a change in power between the personalities.

While the following ages are the most notable, there have been countless changes in power; however, they had less of an impact than the five. One example of a less-important age would be The Age of Separation which didn’t last long and had a short-living impact.
## Age of Beginning
When the world, [[Ahda'an]], and surrounding planets and starts were created by [[Chaos - Sektnan|Sektnan]]. At this moment, Sektnan was only one personality and Ahda’an was a barren gray. Eons passed with such a blank slate. Eons until Sektnan’s next catastrophe (what scholars call drastic changes in the universe).
## Age of Life
After Sektnan’s next catastrophe, [[Iinan]], Creative, was born. Seeing the gray peaks and empty basins, he created the rains and from the rains, plants emerged through his will. The green bore no use, so he created creatures to rely on them. Now the world had meaning. These creatures were simple at first, good and evil had yet to exist. That was quick to change. [[Aanan]], the balancer of good and evil injected their will into Iinan’s creatures, leading to rapid evolution that created sentient life.

While each character was imbued with the concept of the True Religion (Chaos), as sentience grew, they diverged, creating religions that countered Sektnan. Iinan, to ensure some control, created the [[Ardians]], a race imbued with Iinan’s will. To enable them to better exercise said will, Iinan granted them control of their [[Life Essence]], something that each creature has. Yet due to minor catastrophe, this control over Life Essence passed, in varying levels, to other races.

Once Sektnan birthed [[Venan]] and [[Ounan]], sentient societies flourished, progressing to the point of war machines and government ideologies.
## Age of Sin
Many minor catastrophe’s led up to the change in age. Iinan’s power grew too strong, creating unrest amongst the personalities. Aanan turned to Aknan and tainted Ahda’an with evil. Ouknan controlled Ounan and stagnated progress. The personalities were divided as Venan maintained neutrality.

Despite Iinan’s power, the other personalities disregarded their Chaotic contract. Aknan used his power to taint the soul of a human mage, now called the [[War of Sin#Soulless Mage|Soulless Mage]], and drive the elven king, Theornach, to madness. In his madness, Theornach joined the mage in a quest to destroy the Ardian race. The Soulless Mage created twelve beasts, marking the beginning of the true [[War of Sin]].

While Aknan’s will spread throughout the lands, infesting all sentience, save for the [[Dwarves]] and Ardians and a few others spared by Aanan, the beasts tore cities, histories, and cultures. The Ardians, ordered by Iinan to defend his domain, fought against the beasts with their dwindling numbers. They fought tirelessly, yet as they grew close to victory, a decision brought a civil battle amongst the kingdom. Aknan’s power finally reached the Ardians. Should the beasts die or not? Some, the purists, believed in following the laws of Sektnan, others yelled blasphemy. The disagreement grew and Ardian mages took the liberty of sealing the beasts.

While they battled, killing themselves, Theornach did not rest. He hunted the Ardians, manipulated them to continue their murderous rampage. The Ardian civil war did not stop, yet Theornach lost power during the [[Elves#The Elven Revolution|The Elven Revolution]] and the Ardian death toll fell.

Still divided, the Ardian purists (those wining), escaped to Ecrya with the shrine and established defenses to ensure no foreign contact until they were needed again by Iinan. The Ardians remained on the island known as the Forgotten Forest, for all travelers who explored it were lost to sea.

Aanan regained power, yet Ouknan held firm to control.
## Age of Destruction
The most poorly documented/known age. Commonly referred to as the dark ages, it followed only a few dozen years of relative peace amongst nations, until Iknan capitalized a minor catastrophe to seek revenge.

Cultures died as Iinan destroyed what he once made and protected many decades prior. Religions vanished, progress stilled, and beasts more powerful than of the War of Sin roamed the planet. Trade dwindled as oceans became impassible. Yet, as Iinan wreaked havoc on his people, the other personalities used their power to bring people together, to keep them going. 

The purist Ardians stood by, watching on their secluded island, Ecrya. But those for the destruction of the beasts could not sit and do nothing. Those few Ardians assembled the Great Defense: a group who spared the lives of millions while awaiting the end of Iknan’s age. The defense persists still.

Even while protected by the Great Defense, Iiknan never let up. Ounan’s power, which never fully recovered, wore thin again, and the dark age fully ensued. Millions starved and technology stagnated. They did only what they could to stay alive. The war spread to even the Dwarven Kingdoms, something that hadn’t happened during the Age of Sin.

The ever-weakening will of Venan was the only hope for their futures. Not even Aanan could help. Factions formed and wars were waged for food and petty theft. Rage blinded Iiknan as it did many. The line between life and death blurred as magic ability surged for evil and weakened for good. He viewed his creations as toys on a battlefield. 

Only Sektnan could end his cruelty. And so it did. One day, the beasts just disappeared. Iinan tried to wipe any memories of this age from the minds of people, yet some documents survived the eraser. The Defense did all they could to remember their purpose, yet still became a paid militia (mercenaries).
## Age of Reconstruction
The age brought out by the regrowth and restoration of the world. A joyous time when war was solely for the progress of a nation or species, not for mere rations. It was the rebirth of music and technology, of reconciliation within species. Historians recovered lost documents and discovered the pains of destruction and sin. Scientific discoveries spread and boats explored the oceans.

[[Life Essence|Magic]], too, spread, yet the god’s language (spoken predominantly by Ardians) was relatively unknown.

Within the Ardians, hatred still divided them and the anti-purists stole the shrine holding the beasts and stowed it upon [[Ahda’an#Ilya|Ilya]], moving it every few years to others within the resistance.

It is from here that begins the Age of Absence, where, for the decades to come, each personality slowly slipped into their counterparts. Sektnan’s next major catastrophe.
