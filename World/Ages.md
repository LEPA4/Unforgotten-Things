## Introduction
It’s common for there to be times when a specific personality will have more control, and their power will be more potent. During those times, the world can change drastically; for better or worse. Those who still practice the [[Chaos - Sektnan|True Religion]] (the [[Ardians]]), or historians, believe there to be five notable ages: [[#Age of Beginning|The Age of Beginning]], [[#Age of Sin|The Age of Life]], [[#Age of Sin|The Age of Sin]], [[#Age of Destruction|The Age of Destruction]], and [[#Age of Reconstruction|The Age of Reconstruction]]. Each age is represented by a change in power between the personalities.
While the following ages are the most notable, there have been countless changes in power; however, they had less of an impact than the five. One example of a less-important age would be The Age of Separation which didn’t last long and had a short-living impact.
