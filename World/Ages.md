## Introduction
It’s common for there to be times when a specific personality will have more control, and their power will be more potent. During those times, the world can change drastically; for better or worse. Those who still practice the [[Chaos - Sektnan|True Religion]] (the [[Ardians]]), or historians, believe there to be five notable ages: [[#Age of Beginning|The Age of Beginning]], [[#Age of Sin|The Age of Life]], [[#Age of Sin|The Age of Sin]], [[#Age of Destruction|The Age of Destruction]], and [[#Age of Reconstruction|The Age of Reconstruction]]. Each age is represented by a change in power between the personalities.
While the following ages are the most notable, there have been countless changes in power; however, they had less of an impact than the five. One example of a less-important age would be The Age of Separation which didn’t last long and had a short-living impact.
## Age of Beginning
When the world, [[Ahda'an]], and surrounding planets and starts were created by [[Chaos - Sektnan|Sektnan]]. At this moment, Sektnan was only one personality and Ahda’an was a barren gray. Eons passed with such a blank slate. Eons until Sektnan’s next catastrophe (what scholars call drastic changes in the universe).
## Age of Life
After Sektnan’s next catastrophe, [[Iinan]], Creative, was born. Seeing the gray peaks and empty basins, he created the rains and from the rains, plants emerged through his will. The green bore no use, so he created creatures to rely on them. Now the world had meaning. These creatures were simple at first, good and evil had yet to exist. That was quick to change. [[Aanan]], the balancer of good and evil injected their will into Iinan’s creatures, leading to rapid evolution that created sentient life.

While each character was imbued with the concept of the True Religion (Chaos), as sentience grew, they diverged, creating religions that countered Sektnan. Iinan, to ensure some control, created the [[Ardians]], a race imbued with Iinan’s will. To enable them to better exercise said will, Iinan granted them control of their [[Life Essence]], something that each creature has. Yet due to minor catastrophe, this control over Life Essence passed, in varying levels, to other races.
