There are two types of magic: Asking the gods for favors and casting spells through [[Iinan]]’s power.

Asking the gods for favors is the only way to use the power of the other personalities [[Chaos - Sektnan]]. Essentially, this method of magic is praying to a certain personality and granting them an offering to ensure their response. Depending on your connection with Chaos, the offering may be less or more depending on the favor. This way is also a way to use the full power of Creative. Sometimes, the god may ask a favor of the prayer in return.

If the offering isn’t enough and the personality doesn’t need a favor, the offering is consumed, their respect for the prayer lowers and nothing else happens. The prayer isn’t answered. To improve respect, the asker may conduct rituals and offerings to the gods without asking for anything in return. Certain races are liked more by different personalities and different offerings are preferred depending on who one prays to.

If a certain level of trust is established between the creature and the personality, the god may answer the prayer for nothing in return, knowing that they will be repaid in the future. It is also possible to speak with the personality’s counterpart, even when the personality hasn’t switched. To do so, the prayer must have already formed a connection with the god and needs to perform a certain ritual to temporarily bring out the opposing side.

The magic made by Iinan was originally only meant for the [[Ardians]], yet because of it being Chaos, the power spread at differing levels of strength to the other species. This form of magic runs off the concept called Life Essence (many refer to it as Life, Essence, or Energy).

When Iinan created life, the personality gave every living thing Life Essence. This essence was not only how he ensured the death of creatures, but also the ability to control them. Not all species have the same amount of essence and they lose it at differing speeds — Elves and Humans have different amounts of life essence, which is why Elves live much longer. Within one species, there can be small deviations in how much each is granted, sometimes large. When a creature runs out of Life Essence, they die.

Upon request of the other personalities, Iinan gave them some control over Energy to let them carry out their purposes.

The magic given to all creatures was some of the god’s power. To cast a spell, one must use words from the god’s tongue to command their life essence. Creative did this to further ensure the Ardian’s success as they are naturally able to speak the god’s tongue well.

Certain spells and commands use more energy, meaning a spell can kill the caster. Yet it is also possible to use the energy of another living thing. To do so, one must overpower the will and mental fortitude of another, or the other may willingly give their life for a spell. Because Lawful had some control over Essence, he ensured the caster’s slow loss in sanity and a quicker loss in Life Essence, the caster will lose their humanity and themselves. Whenever Lawful turns to Lawless, the rules in place are lifted.

It is also possible to perform necromancy. To reanimate the dead or create another creature (like what the mage did during the [[Ages#Age of Sin|Age of Sin]]) one must put their Life Essence into another thing (it doesn’t have to be an organic thing). Or they can use the power of creation to make a new life-form, though it uses an extraordinary amount of Energy to do so.

Once a spell is cast, the only way to regain it naturally is through rest or food (food gives energy and rest restores it as the energy slowly returns to the caster’s body after the spell ends). It is possible to speed the process of the spell’s return through deep-meditation. It is also possible to intercept the Life as it returns to another’s body as it has little of the mage’s willpower left. The mage can strengthen their life through mental training to ensure it is more difficult to steal.
When one dies on the battlefield or another unnatural death, their remaining energy slowly leaves the body and returns to Creative, however it is possible to take that with ease. That is because the body still had Live Essence stored within. Also, when an injury is obtained, the Life Essence will be used to heal the wound unless the wound is too-fatal, in which case the Energy will kill you and the person dies.

Magic ability is the ability to use less essence during casting and magic strength is the power of the magic as well as how much willpower is held within. To improve both, the mind and body must be strengthened. Mind makes it so the spell uses less energy and increases the willpower carried by the spell. It also makes it easier to control others. Body increases the strength of the magic and also increases the amount of energy the body can hold. Fat stores a lot of energy, yet it’s a weak energy and spells are less powerful, while muscle gives for stronger spells. This means that magic ability and strength can be changed.

It is also possible to store essence in other objects. It is also possible to slow the loss of essence over time.

Sometimes, a different wording of a spell may make it more efficient and effective.
